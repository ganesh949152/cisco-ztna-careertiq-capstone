# Connected Public Transportation System

## Overview
A comprehensive network security implementation for public transportation systems, designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project demonstrates how to integrate multiple transportation modes (buses, trams, and emergency vehicles) under a centralized control system while maintaining robust security through Zero Trust Architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Security Implementation
- **Multi-Layer Firewall Protection**
  - Comprehensive inbound and outbound traffic control
  - Advanced ACL (Access Control List) implementation
  - Real-time threat monitoring and prevention

- **Zero Trust Architecture**
  - Strict MAC address filtering
  - Device-level authentication
  - Granular access control policies

- **RADIUS Authentication**
  - Centralized authentication system
  - Role-based access control
  - Secure credential management

### Network Design
- **VLAN Segmentation**
  - Isolated network segments for different transportation modes
  - Reduced broadcast domains
  - Enhanced security through network segregation

- **Centralized Management**
  - Unified control system
  - Real-time monitoring capabilities
  - Streamlined administration
