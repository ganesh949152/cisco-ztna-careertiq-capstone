Connected Public Transportation System Using Multiple Secure Layers and Zero Trust Architecture:
This project demonstrates the design, configuration, and implementation of a secure network for a connected public transportation system using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network integrates multiple transportation modes, such as buses, trams, and emergency vehicles, under centralized control, leveraging VLAN segmentation, firewalls, and Radius authentication for enhanced security.

Key features:

Firewalls & ACLs: Enforces access control rules to secure both inbound and outbound traffic.
Radius Authentication: Adds a layer of authorization, ensuring that only trusted devices can access the network.
MAC Filtering: Implements Zero Trust by ensuring only authorized devices connect.

This repository includes the Packet Tracer simulation files and documentation detailing the project architecture, security measures, and test results. Future work includes cloud integration and advanced threat detection mechanisms.
